To do list:

- Seems like a basic app to connect to WebSocket (Make property file for ip, port and token) (NOTE: Set max_size limit due to note that said message might 200GB in length...)
- Send message AUTH JWT_TOKEN <= Either AUTH <token> or AUTH JWT_TOKEN <token> (Need to test)
- Message can be string or binary
	String starts with $ and ends with ;
	Binary has header [0]=0xAA, [1]=payload size, [6 till end]=payload
		-> Never played with endpoint that return different type of datatype... should be interesting...  Probably just checkn the first character to determine type
-Send message STATUS to terminate message generation, then disconnet (btw, make sure that there's more message in socket, basically flushed, Python Websocket should already handle it)
-Message are sent to SQLite table, 1 for ascii and 1 for binary (probably log the time and add incremental number + index, and original text)
-Stop after 600 messaage is received

-Separate app to validate message? Seperate script? or Just a seperate function... Probably just make a REST service that reads message and then tag it as invalid if incorrect...

1. Socket, not websocket
2. Message from socket can contain both ascii and binary... Need to handle it...
3. Message can come in multiple parts, you will need to handle such messages
	ascii:
		Must be length >= 5
		Only printable ascii
		Start with $ and end with ;, since size is unknown, looping thru each index is require. Need to ensure is printable ascii too
	binary:
		[0] = 0xaa
		[1:6] = size
		[6:] = payload (Can extend to next message if current message < size)
4. Send STATUS to end messages, still call recv to drain the pipe till exception is reach
5. Save message to DB, use ORM
	5.1 Save raw message for reference. Also add relationship to link raw messages (multiple) to 1 ascii/binary
