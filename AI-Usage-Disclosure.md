# AI Usage

The project mostly refers to Stackoverflow and Python documentation. However, there are some parts where AI was used to get some ideas

## Where AI was used
- connector.DataFetch.py
  - AI was used to get an idea on how to connect. I initially thought WebSockets and Socket was the same thing, so couldn't figure out why WebSockets cannot connect. 
- ORM Module peewee
  - AI was used to get a list of Python ORM as I usually work with DataFrames and just perform a full overwrite. Peewee was among the ORM recommended
- AsciiParser.py
  - AI was used to get the range of printable ASCII (Could have just Google Search... Was just a bit lazy in this instance)
- BinaryParser.py
  - AI was used to figure out how to convert 5-bytes data to number
- Module logging
  - AI was used to get an idea on how to control logging from 1 file

 ## Additional Notes
 - AI was not used in the core logic to fetch and traverse thru the messages
   - Code could have been rewritten to use recursion instead (AI could help?)
